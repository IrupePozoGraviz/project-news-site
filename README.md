# News Site

Precourse project for Technigo- to build our own newssite.

## The problem
I started with going through the tutorials from the material we got from Technigo. As this is the first time I code I also watched alot of others tutorials and googled alot to try to understand how flex and grid works and how to use it to make a responsive homepage.

After that I sketched an Idea on how I wanted my newssite to look like and then I started figuring out what I needed to be able to build the site. It took me alot of time to figure flex and grid out and its something I need to keep on working with as I'm still not totaly friends with neither of them. The hardest part for me was that as everything is so new I still have to understand why and what elemenst to sue and how to look them up. Ive done my page but I need to really keep on playing and building pages to try the different components and really understand how they work.

If I had more time I would work alot more with the layout and play more with flex and grid and try to make a newssite that looked abit more like a newssite. 

I would have a footer for example that I wasnt able to figure out why it always hid behind all my pictures.
